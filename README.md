# Academic-Performance-Evaluation-System

This is an Academic Performance Evaluation System Project.

This application evaluates the Final Grades of students by considering Mid-semester 1 exams, Mid-semester 2 exams, Semester exams, and Internal Marks.

{To start the application, open the "intro1.java" and run it on your system after importing all the files}**

*  I've used JavaSE and Java SWING in Front-end.
* MongoDB database has been used in the back-end.
